# stocK_price_prediction
Coursework


This folder contains the main.py , where you will find all of the code used throughout the assessment.
There is a subfolder, where it contains a chart that shows the correlation between companies by each sector.

Please do not add any more .csv file to the folder, otherwise main.py will not run properly.




Although some code is referenced, other code referencing was lost along the way. This is because the code is far too complex to add refernces everytime a line of code appears.

Some of the code was retrieved from module documentation, stack overflow and Towards Data Science
