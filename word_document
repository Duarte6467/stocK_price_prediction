Abstract:

The statistical study of Stock Markets around the world have always been considered as a stochastic process. However, with the aid of technical indicators developed 
inside the stock market and with exponential development of algorithms in Machine Learning, the stock market may be somewhat predicatble. In other words, an analysis
in the stock market seems less stochastic. Thus, in this paper, we will use Machine Learning Algorithms, such as Linear/Logisitc Regression and Support Vector Machines
to try to predict which sectors included in the FTSE100 Index are likely to increease/decrease in the short-run.
